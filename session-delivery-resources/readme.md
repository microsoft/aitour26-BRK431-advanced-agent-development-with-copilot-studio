### 🏋️Preparation

To prepare to deliver the demos in this session, perform the following steps:
- Ensure you have access to an M365 Tenant which has Copilot Studio licensing
- Install the [Zava solution file](/src/Zava_1_0_0_1.zip) in your Power Platform environment. This contains the agents and the underlying Dataverse tables that you need for the demos
- Create sample data in the installed Dataverse tables
- Download the [sample files](/src/samplefiles/) so you can reference them in the agents
- Review the demo videos below to ensure you understand the flow of the demos
